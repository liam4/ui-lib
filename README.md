t[erminal] ui-lib[rary]

A handy but incomprehensibly (un)useful DOM-like library for writing visual terminal programs.

My examples for you are the dumb pieces of code I've written with this:

* [Knights & a Relatively Minimal Number of Dragons](https://github.com/towerofnix/KAaRMNoD/)
* [DQ9 mapper](https://github.com/towerofnix/dq9-mapper)

There are also some very, *very* minimalistic examples in [the examples folder](https://github.com/towerofnix/ui-lib/tree/master/examples).
